        <h1>Intro:</h1>
        In this page, you will learn more about me and my journey as a Web
        Developer. My name is
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-albert-docus-17aa63273/"
          >Daniel Docus</a
        >, I was born in Honolulu, Hawaii on April 13th, 2002. Though I lived
        there for five years, most of my life has been in Las Vegas, Nevada,
        which is my current home. I've been studying Web Development on my own
        and decided to take
        <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/">Correlation One</a>'s
        Software Development Program to further my knowledge and push my future
        towards a career that I will enjoy.

        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        One of the things that I enjoy doing during my leisure time is playing
        video games! It is something that has been apart of my life since I was
        a child. Games that I enjoy playing are (but not limited to): League of
        Legends, Honkai: Star Rail, Deep Rock Galactic, Gunfire Reborn, The
        Division 2, and many more. Besides video games, I enjoy playing guitar!
        I picked it up during highschool and ended up learning a few of my
        favorite songs! (Here's my Gaming Setup! --- >)

        <h1>My Journey:</h1>
        Before I began the Correlation One Software Development program I self
        taught myself front-end developing and took courses on my own whenever I
        had the time. I learned HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. Now
        that Iâ€™m taking the Correlation One program, I have improved my
        knowledge of HTML, CSS and Career Development. I look forward to
        learning more! The most interesting thing so far is CSS in general. I
        find it the most interesting to me because I like making things look
        aesthetically pleasing.
